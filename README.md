# Find Local Maxima

An simple algorithm to detect local maxima. 
Tuning parameters are:
- the savgol filter parameters with respect to data size
- n: the size of searching area 
- num_of_maxima: total number of local maxima in descending order.

The included datasets are taken from X-ray Powder Diffraction Analysis.
